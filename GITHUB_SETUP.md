# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Repository Ready for Publishing!

Your Market Data Pipeline monorepo is ready to be published to GitHub. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. **Repository name**: `market-data-pipelines`
3. **Description**: 
   ```
   Comprehensive market data pipeline with modern uv and traditional venv implementations. Features shell orchestration, technical indicators, automated reporting, and quantitative finance analysis tools.
   ```
4. **Visibility**: Public (to showcase your work)
5. **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/market-data-pipelines
git push -u origin main

   - `python`
   - `shell-scripting`
   - `technical-analysis`
   - `yfinance`
   - `trading`
   - `data-pipeline`
   - `uv`
   - `venv`
   - `financial-analysis`
   - `automation`
   - `monitoring`
   - `devops`
